            <h2> Nebula Corp's History </h2>
            <p> Andrew D. Nebula, the founder of The Nebula Corporation, was born in 1926 in a small hospital in southern California. Andrew was the son of Jhon Nebula, who made a living in repairing radios and other small electronics in San Francisco. Because of his father’s career Andrew grew up with a passion and interest for all things technology. Rather than playing with toys, Andrew preferred to help his dad tinker in their garage. After high school Andrew was still set to pursue his passion, so he enrolled in The San Francisco University of Technology. After graduating in 1948, Andrew spent the next few years saving money to start his own technological research company. 
                Finally in 1951 he was able to afford a small shop in San Francisco and enough equipment to start his dream, and on Feb 19, 1951, he founded The Nebula Corporation. The Nebula Corporation had humble beginnings barely being able to stay afloat until they were able to file a patent for a portable holographic projector in 1955. This sold very well and even saw some use by the U.S military. Nebula Corp made a name for itself during the cold war by making barely detectable micro cameras for the U.S government. Nebula Corp also played a significant role in the space race helping America be the first on the moon by cooperating with NASA on aerospace research. </p>

                <h2>The Future of Nebula Corp</h2>
                <p>The Nebula Corporation has many plans for the future. As of now Nebula Corp’s biggest biggest focus is to be the first to establish a fully functional research facility on mars. Very recently our team of astronauts have touched down on the surface of mars with no issues so far. Many recent agreements with the United States Government and NASA have opened up many new possibilities for the future of Nebula Corp.</p>
